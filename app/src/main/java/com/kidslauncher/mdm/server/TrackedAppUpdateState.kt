 * not the app's Android package name - that's optional server-side now and can't be trusted to be

     * This matters because [AppInstaller.installSilently]'s `PackageInstaller.Session.commit()`
     * returns immediately - the real result only arrives later via [AppInstallReceiver], well after
     * `performMdmSync` (and the `syncMutex` guarding it) has already returned. The mutex prevents
     * two sync cycles from running *concurrently*, but does nothing to stop a *later, non-
     * overlapping* cycle from re-attempting an app whose previous attempt simply hasn't resolved
     * yet - confirmed live: checking a second app while the first was still installing caused the
     * first app's install to restart from a fresh cycle's redundant attempt, and the second app's
     * own attempt never completed, ending with it selected/allowed but never actually installed.
     *
     * Recorded before the download even starts (not just before `installSilently`), since the
     * whole download+install span is the window a later cycle shouldn't re-enter. Cleared by
     * [recordInstalled]/[recordFailed] once `AppInstallReceiver` resolves the real result, or by
     * [clearAttempt] on an earlier failure (download error, exception) where that receiver is never
     * reached at all. If neither ever fires - the process dies mid-attempt, or the callback is
     * somehow lost - the timeout in `checkForTrackedAppUpdates` reclaims it instead of blocking
     * retries forever.
